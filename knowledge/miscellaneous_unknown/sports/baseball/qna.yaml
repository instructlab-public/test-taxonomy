      The Orleans Firebirds are a collegiate summer baseball team based in
      Orleans, Mass. The Firebirds are one of 10 members of the Cape Cod
      Baseball League, the nation's top college summer league.

      Formerly known as the Sparklers and Cardinals, the Firebirds are 11-time
      CCBL champions. The Birds most recently captured the league title in 2005,
      when they defeated the Bourne Braves in two games.

      Baseball has been played at Eldredge Park since 1913, and Orleans
      officially entered the CCBL in 1928. The team captured its first titles
      following World War II, when it won seven championships from 1947 to 1957.

      The CCBL became a NCAA-recognized league in 1963, bringing collegiate
      athletes from across the country to each team. Orleans adopted the
      Cardinal as its new mascot and reached the league championship series four
      times in the next decade.


      Orleans won its first modern-era championship in 1986, led by manager John
      Castleberry. The Birds captured their next two titles in 1993 with Rolando
      Casanova at the helm, and in 2003 under manager Carmen Carcone.

      Current field manager Kelly Nicholson joined the team in 2005 and led the
      Birds to a championship in his first season en route to Manager of the
      Year honors.

      Our home field of Eldredge Park, located next to Nauset Middle School in
      Orleans, was named “the best summer collegiate park in the nation” in 2004
      by Baseball America. The picturesque park has served Orleans for more than
      100 years after being originally founded in the early 1900s by local Lewis
      Winslow “Win” Eldredge in the interests of young people of Orleans needing
      a playground.

      Today, Eldredge Park is a mainstay attraction for the Town of Orleans.
      With modern amenities and charms once described by Philadelphia Reporter
      Joe Parillo as a “Normal Rockwell painting come to life,” a visit to
      Eldredge Park is at the top of all Cape Codders’ summer bucket lists.
